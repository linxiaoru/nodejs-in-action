#### 定义
> a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

- 事件驱动（用事件轮询）
- 非阻塞 I/O 模型（用异步 I/O）
